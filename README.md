# HebbianLerning
Hebbian learning that incorporates LTP- and LTD-like weight adjustments. The algorithm was used and described in 
Tovar, A. E., Westermann, G., and Torres, A. (2018).

It uses Hebbian learning, and uses strenghtening and weakening of
connections to stabilize and limit weight values. Connection weights are
modeled following notions of long term potentiation and long term depression
